//Conventionally, the bin/www file in an Express server is the entry file or the starting point to start the Express server.

//The intention of the ./bin/www file is for it to be an executable script, meaning that you could start the application by simply entering the file name in the terminal as a command: bin/www

// Import environment variables
require('dotenv').config();

const { port } = require('../config');

const app = require('../app');
const db = require('../db/models');

// Check the database connection before starting the app
db.sequelize
  .authenticate()
  .then(() => {
    console.log('Database connection success! Sequelize is ready to use...');

    // Start listening for connections
    app.listen(port, () => console.log(`Listening on port ${port}...`));
  })
  .catch((err) => {
    console.log('Database connection failure.');
    console.error(err);
  });

//Here, you will be starting your Express application to listen for server requests only after authenticating your database connection.
