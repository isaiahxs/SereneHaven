Backend Login Flow
-The API login route will be hit with a request body holding a valid credential (either username or email) and password combination.
-The API login handler will look for a User with the input credential in either the username or email columns.
-Then the hashedPassword for that found User will be compared with the input password for a match.
-If there is a match, the API login route should send back a JWT in an HTTP-only cookie and a response body. The JWT and the body will hold the user's id, username, and email.


Backend Sign-up Flow
-The API signup route will be hit with a request body holding a username, email, and password.
-The API signup handler will create a User with the username, an email, and a hashedPassword created from the input password.
-If the creation is successful, the API signup route should send back a JWT in an HTTP-only cookie and a response body. The JWT and the body will hold the user's id, username, and email.


Backend Logout Flow
-The API logout route will be hit with a request.
-The API logout handler will remove the JWT cookie set by the login or signup API routes and return a JSON success message.

Completed Phase 3
Completed Phase 4
Completed Phase 5. Need to run a few more checks on firstName and lastName section though.

Push for 2/9/23






Deployment failed. These are the changes I'm making:

- added production key including internal database url for Postgres in backend/config/index.js
- removed 'test' line from scripts section in /package.json
- checked psql-setup-script.js file and it looks good
    - checked backend/package.json file and build command looks good
- looks like I still have the test thing in backend/package.json, is that a problem?

- added the options code into the new migration where i was adding and removing firstName lastName columns
    - reorganized second migration with Bill's advice

//the random @type import things like in seeder file, should those be commented out or not?


Successfully completed deployment


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Now working on models and migrations

-created tables with their names and attributes
-created assocations in the models
-edited the migration files to have the options things

think i need to add columns to Users of 'credential, password'



------------------------------------------------------
airbnb spot links - andres and blake recommended stock photo urls since they won't change as frequently. so what i can do, is find a unique external house picture. then find multiple indoor pictures that will go with that house. doesn't necessarily have to perfectly match, but it will result in the least maintenance over time and it still gets the message across.

going to have to create a lot of seed data.
